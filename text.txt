To analyze your code and understand why you're only getting "best match: unknown" with a large distance, we need to consider several points:

Feature Vector Extraction:
The extractFeatures function should correctly extract the desired number of features from the input image. However, it seems the function is returning a feature vector filled with zeros, which could be a reason for not finding a match.

Database Loading:
The loadDatabase function should correctly load the database from the specified file path. There might be an issue if the file is not found, the format is incorrect, or the feature vectors in the database are not valid.

Distance Calculation:
The scaledEuclideanDistance function calculates the distance between two feature vectors, taking the standard deviation into account. If the standard deviation is very small, it can lead to very large distance values. There may also be a problem if the feature vectors have different sizes, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

Debugging:
To debug the process, you need to ensure that every function is working as expected by using debugging techniques such as logging intermediate values to the console or a file.

Here's a step-by-step approach to debug your code:

Check the Database:
Ensure objectDB.txt is correctly formatted and contains valid data.

Debug extractFeatures Function:
Make sure that this function is actually extracting features and not just returning a vector of zeros. You can debug this by printing the contents of the features vector before returning it from the function.

Validate loadDatabase Function:
After loading the database, print the size and contents of the loaded feature vectors to verify that they are correct.

Analyze scaledEuclideanDistance:
After computing the distance between feature vectors, print the distance values to ensure they are reasonable and not always giving a large value like 1.79769e+308.

Standard Deviation Issues:
Check the computeFeatureStdevs function to ensure that the standard deviations are not so small that they're causing the distance calculation to overflow.

Console Output Not Showing:
If std::cout statements are not displaying, it could be due to buffering. Try adding std::flush or std::endl to force the buffer to flush after each print statement. If the application is crashing before it gets to print, you may not see any output.

Assertion Failure:
The assertion failure shown in the debug window suggests a vector subscript is out of range. This could be from accessing an element in a vector that doesn't exist, such as using an incorrect index. Check where you're accessing elements in vectors and ensure you're not going out of bounds.

You may need to step through the code with a debugger to inspect variables and the flow of execution at each step. This will allow you to see where the logic may be going wrong and why the expected output is not being produced.
