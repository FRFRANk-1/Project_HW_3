This project entails creating a 2D object recognition system with the capability to recognize, categorize, and track objects in real-time or through processed image sequences. Here’s a structured approach to tackle this project, starting from setting up your development environment to implementing each functionality step by step:

Project Setup and Structure
Development Environment Setup:

Ensure OpenCV is properly installed and configured in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for C++ development.
If you plan to switch from MinGW to MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++ compiler), make sure you have the Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools installed.
Project Structure:

Main.cpp: Entry point of your program that orchestrates the flow of data through different modules (tasks).
ImageProcessor.h/cpp: For pre-processing tasks like thresholding and morphological operations.
Segmentation.h/cpp: For connected components analysis and region segmentation.
FeatureExtractor.h/cpp: For calculating moments, bounding boxes, and other features.
Classifier.h/cpp: For implementing and handling the classification logic.
ObjectDatabase.h/cpp: For managing the training data and feature vectors of known objects.
Utility.h/cpp: For general utility functions like reading/writing data, displaying results, etc.
Implementation Steps
Task 1: Thresholding
Implement Thresholding: Start by writing a function in ImageProcessor.cpp to apply a thresholding algorithm to separate objects from the background. Consider using adaptive thresholding methods that can dynamically adjust based on the image's lighting conditions.
Display Thresholded Video: Ensure your main application loop can display the thresholded output in real-time or frame-by-frame for video sequences or single images.
Task 2: Morphological Filtering
Morphological Operations: Implement morphological filtering functions to clean up the binary image from thresholding. This could involve operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing to remove noise and fill holes.
Choose and Apply Operations: Based on the observed noise and artifacts in your thresholded images, decide which morphological operations to apply and in what sequence.
Task 3: Image Segmentation
Connected Components Analysis: Implement or use OpenCV’s connected components functions to segment the cleaned image into distinct regions.
Display Regions: Enhance your display functionality to visualize these regions with different colors or labels, ignoring regions below a size threshold.
Task 4: Compute Features
Feature Calculation: Write functions to compute features for each identified region. Start with basic features like the axis of least central moment and oriented bounding box. If you choose to write your own, focus on translation, scale, and rotation-invariant features.
Display Features: Modify your display functionality to overlay these features on the output image.
Task 5: Collect Training Data
Training Mode: Implement a training mode in your application that allows you to label objects and store their feature vectors in a database (e.g., a simple file or a more structured database).
Task 6: Classify New Images
Implement Classification: Use the nearest-neighbor method initially to classify objects based on the closest matching feature vector from your training data.
Display Classification: Show the identified label on the output image or video stream.
Task 7: Evaluate Performance
Testing and Confusion Matrix: Test your system with multiple images of each object in various positions and orientations. Manually record the results and construct a confusion matrix to evaluate performance.
Task 8: System Demonstration
Capture a Demo: Record a video demonstration of your system in action, showcasing its ability to recognize and label objects in real-time or through processed sequences.
Task 9: Implement a Second Classification Method
Alternative Classifier: Explore implementing a different classification approach, such as K-Nearest Neighbors or using a pre-trained deep learning model for feature extraction. Compare its performance with your initial method.
Development Tips
Incremental Development: Work on one task at a time and test thoroughly before moving on to the next task. This approach helps in isolating issues and ensures that each component works as expected.
Modular Code: Keep your code modular. Writing separate classes or functions for each task makes it easier to manage and debug.
Version Control: Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your code. It allows you to keep track of changes and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.
Documentation: Document your code and your decision-making process. This will be invaluable when writing your report and for future you or others who may work on the project.
This structured approach should guide you through completing your 2D object recognition project systematically, from setting up your development environment to implementing each component of the system.
